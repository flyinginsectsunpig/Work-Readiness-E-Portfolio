# 🌟 Work Readiness E-Portfolio

Welcome to my digital portfolio, developed as part of the Work Readiness Training Programme. This portfolio showcases evidence of my learning, personal growth, and professional development. It is structured according to four key elements: **Collect, Select, Reflect, and Connect** — aligned with the principles of higher education e-portfolios.

Each section contains relevant artefacts (evidence) and reflections using the **STAR technique** (Situation, Task, Action, Result), as outlined in the assessment rubric.

## 🧩 Connections & Summary

This portfolio is a synthesis of multiple learning components — career guidance, self-assessment, documentation, and real-world application. Each section not only showcases growth in isolation but connects to a larger narrative of becoming work-ready in a competitive, ever-changing world.
