# ðŸŒŸ Reflection: Skills and Interests (STAR Technique)

**SITUATION**  
During the training, we completed a skills and interests assessment that revealed our strengths and potential career matches.

**TASK**  
I needed to understand how my current skills aligned with career options and identify any gaps I needed to address.

**ACTION**  
After receiving the assessment results, I compared them with job descriptions in fields Iâ€™m interested in. I identified communication, problem-solving, and tech proficiency as skills I already possessed.

**RESULT**  
The assessment helped me recognize my strengths and boosted my self-awareness. I now approach tasks with confidence, knowing what I excel at and where I want to grow.
