# ðŸŒŸ Reflection: Personality Assessment (STAR Technique)

**SITUATION**  
We completed a personality assessment for the Work Integrated Learning.

**TASK**  
The objective was to understand how my personality affects my teamwork, communication, and work preferences.

**ACTION**  
I reviewed my personality profile and reflected on past group projects. I realized that my tendency to listen carefully and support others made me a natural team player, but I also needed to assert my ideas more confidently.

**RESULT**  
Understanding my personality type has helped me work more effectively in teams by balancing listening with contributing. I also learned how to better manage my energy during busy periods, making me more productive and focused.
